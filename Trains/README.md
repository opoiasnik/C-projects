# Documentation for Train Station Management System

## Overview

This C program simulates a train station management system. It focuses on managing a train represented by a linked list, where each node (`car`) corresponds to a station. The program provides functionalities such as adding a new station to the train, printing the current list of stations, removing a specific station, and cancelling the entire train.

## Key Components

- **Structures**:
  - `car`: Represents a train car with a station name (`value`) and a pointer to the next car (`next`).

- **Constants**:
  - `SIZE`: Defines the maximum length of a station name.

## Functions

### Main Functions

- `main()`: Drives the application. It handles user input and calls appropriate functions based on the user's choice.

### Utility Functions

- `add_car(struct car* first, const char* target)`: Adds a new station to the end of the train.
- `print_train(struct car* first)`: Prints all the stations in the train.
- `cancel_train(struct car* first)`: Cancels the entire train, freeing all allocated memory.
- `clear_train(struct car* first, const char* target)`: Removes a specific station from the train.

## Function Descriptions

### `add_car(struct car* first, const char* target)`

- **Purpose**: Adds a new `car` (station) to the end of the train.
- **Parameters**:
  - `first`: Pointer to the first car in the train.
  - `target`: Station name to be added.
- **Returns**: Pointer to the first car in the updated train.

### `print_train(struct car* first)`

- **Purpose**: Prints all the stations in the train.
- **Parameters**:
  - `first`: Pointer to the first car in the train.

### `cancel_train(struct car* first)`

- **Purpose**: Cancels the entire train, freeing memory of all cars.
- **Parameters**:
  - `first`: Pointer to the first car in the train.

### `clear_train(struct car* first, const char* target)`

- **Purpose**: Removes a specific station from the train.
- **Parameters**:
  - `first`: Pointer to the first car in the train.
  - `target`: Station name to be removed.
- **Returns**: Pointer to the first car in the updated train.

## Usage

Compile and run the program using a C compiler. Interact with the program through the console. Choose from the menu options to add new stations, view the current train, remove a station, or cancel the entire train.

## Limitations

- The program operates in a console environment and does not feature a graphical user interface.
- It handles a single train at a time.
- The system relies on manual memory management, which requires careful handling to avoid memory leaks.

## Conclusion

This program offers a simple yet effective way to simulate train station management in C. It provides basic functionalities to add, remove, and view stations on a train, demonstrating linked list operations and memory management in C.
